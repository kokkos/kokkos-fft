Reviews
=======
Code review is an essential part of our development process. It is always appreciated to first open issues or ask questions on the 
Kokkos slack channel before making PRs. A "good" PR is detailed in `the kokkos documentation <https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/developer-guides/prs-and-reviews.html>`_.

When your pull request is ready for review, please:

- **PR Description:** Ensure your PR description includes the context for the changes.
- **Formatting:** Format your code following :doc:`our guideline<CI>`.
- **Adding unit-tests:** If your PR adds a new feature, add unit-tests for that feature (see :doc:`details of CI<CI>`).
- **Adding docstrings:** Add `doxygen style docstrings <https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html>`_ for APIs.
- **Responding to Feedback:** Actively communiate with reviewers and address any feedback.
- **Approval Process:** Wait for approval from one or more core reviewers.
