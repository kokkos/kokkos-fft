# Summary

kokkos-fft implements local (non-distributed) interfaces between Kokkos and de facto standard FFT libraries, including fftw, cufft, hipfft (rocfft), and oneMKL. The key concept of kokkos-fft is "As easy as numpy, as fast as vendor libraries". This library has simple interface like numpy.fft with in-place and out-of-place transforms, while keeping the performance portability. An exercise to solve the 2D Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence with the Fourier spectral method demonstrates that we can achieve a signficiant speed up against python version without increasing the lines of code (LOC) drastically. This library allows the user to perform FFTs efficiently and simply in the kokkos eco system.

# Statement of need

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a family of fundamental algorithms that is widely used in scientific computing and other areas [@Rockmore2000]. [kokkos-fft](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-fft) is designed to help [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos) [@Trott2022] users who are:

* using Kokkos to port a legacy application which relies on FFT libraries. E.g., fluid simulation codes with periodic boundaries, plasma turbulence, etc.

* wishing to integrate in-situ signal and image processing with FFTs. E.g., spectral analyses, low pass filtering, etc.

* willing to use de facto standard FFT libraries just like [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html) [@Harris2020].

kokkos-fft can benefit such users through the following features:

* A simple interface like [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html) with in-place and out-of-place transforms:  
Only accepts [Kokkos Views](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/view/view.html) which corresponds to the [numpy.array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html), to make APIs simple and safe.

* 1D, 2D, 3D standard and real FFT functions (similar to [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html)) over 1D to 8D Kokkos Views:  
Batched plans are automatically used if View dimension is larger than FFT dimension.

* A reusable [FFT plan](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/plan/plan.html) which wraps the vendor libraries for each Kokkos backend:  
[fftw](http://www.fftw.org), [cufft](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft), [hipfft](https://github.com/ROCm/hipFFT) ([rocfft](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT)), and [oneMKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) are automatically enabled based on the enabled Kokkos backend.

* Support for multiple CPU and GPU backends:  
FFT libraries for the enabled Kokkos backend are executed on the stream/queue used in that [`ExecutionSpace`](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/execution_spaces.html) where the parallel operations are performed.

* Compile time and/or runtime errors for invalid usage (e.g. `View` extents mismatch).

# How to use kokkos-fft

For those who are familiar with [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html), you may use kokkos-fft quite easily. In fact, all of the numpy.fft functions (`numpy.fft.<function_name>`) have an analogous counterpart in kokkos-fft (`KokkosFFT::<function_name>`), which can run on the Kokkos device. In addition, kokkos-fft supports [in-place transform](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/using.html#inplace-transform) and [plan reuse](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/using.html#reuse-fft-plan) capabilities.

Let's start with a simple example to perform the 1D real to complex transform using `rfft` in kokkos-fft.

```C++
#include <Kokkos_Core.hpp>
#include <Kokkos_Complex.hpp>
#include <Kokkos_Random.hpp>
#include <KokkosFFT.hpp>
using ExecutionSpace = Kokkos::DefaultExecutionSpace;
template <typename T> using View1D = Kokkos::View<T*, ExecutionSpace>;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  Kokkos::ScopeGuard guard(argc, argv);
  const int n = 4;
  View1D<double> x("x", n);
  View1D<Kokkos::complex<double> > x_hat("x_hat", n/2+1);
  Kokkos::Random_XorShift64_Pool<> random_pool(12345);
  Kokkos::fill_random(x, random_pool, 1);
  KokkosFFT::rfft(ExecutionSpace(), x, x_hat);
  Kokkos::fence();
}
```

This is equivalent to the following python code.

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.random.rand(4)
x_hat = np.fft.rfft(x)
```

There are two additional arguments in the Kokkos version:

* An instance of the [`ExecutionSpace`](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/execution_spaces.html) wherein the operations are performed.
* The output View (`x_hat`).

Also, kokkos-fft only accepts [Kokkos Views](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/view/view.html) as input data. The accessibility of a View from `ExecutionSpace` is statically checked and will result in a compilation error if not accessible. See [documentations](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/quick_start.html) for basic usage.

# Benchmark: 2D Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence with the Fourier spectral method

As a more scientific example, we solve a typical 2D plasma turbulence model, called the Hasegawa-Wakatani equation [@Wakatani1984] using the Fourier spectral method (see \autoref{fig:hw2D} for the vorticity structure).

![Vorticity.\label{fig:hw2D}](hw2D.png)

Using Kokkos and kokkos-fft, we can easily implement the code, just like Python, while getting a significant acceleration. As described in the [documentation](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-fft/tree/main/examples/10_HasegawaWakatani/README.md), the core computational kernel of the code is the nonlinear term which is computed with FFTs. We construct the forward and backward FFT plans once in initialization which are reused in the time evolution loops.

We have performed a benchmark of this application over multiple backends. We performed a simulation for 100 steps with a resolution of `1024 x 1024` while I/Os are disabled. The following table shows the achieved performance.

| Device | Icelake (python) | Icelake | A100 | H100 | MI250X | PVC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kokkos Backend | - | OpenMP | CUDA | CUDA | HIP | SYCL |
| LOC | 568 | 738 | 738 | 738 | 738 | 738 |
| Compiler/version | Python 3.12.3 | IntelLLVM 2023.0.0 | nvcc 12.2 | nvcc 12.3 | rocm 5.7 | IntelLLVM 2024.0.2 |
| GB/s (Theoretical peak) | 205 | 205 | 1555 | 3350 | 1600 | 3276.8 |
| Elapsed time [s] | 463 | 9.28 | 0.25 | 0.14 | 0.41 | 0.30 |
| Speed up | x 1 | x 49.9 | x 1852 | x 3307 | x 1129 | x 1562 |

Here, the testbed includes Intel Xeon Platinum 8360Y (referred to as Icelake), NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, AMD MI250X GPU (1 GCD) and Intel Data Center GPU Max 1550 (referred to as PVC). On Icelake, we use 36 cores with OpenMP parallelization. As expected, the Python version is the simplest in terms of lines of code (LOC), which is definitively a good aspect of Python. With Kokkos and kokkos-fft, the same logic can be implemented without significantly increasing the source code size (roughly 1.5 times longer). However, the performance gain is enormous, allowing a speedup as high as 3000 times on the H100 GPU.
